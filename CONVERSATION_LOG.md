# Ringly Development Log

## Project Overview
A web application to help users design and customize their perfect engagement ring, built with React, TypeScript, and 3D rendering capabilities. I typically use Windows on my Laptop and PC. Please default to Windows-based instructions & commands.

## Session History

### Initial Setup and Core Features (February 2024)
- Set up TypeScript monorepo with vite and Yarn workspaces
- Created basic React application structure
- Implemented ThreeJS/WebGL integration for 3D rendering
- Added Supabase backend integration
- Created basic ring customization interface

### 3D Visualization and UI Improvements
- Implemented 3D ring model rendering
- Added material visualization with realistic textures:
  - Metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum)
  - Gemstones (Diamonds, Sapphires, etc.)
- Created responsive sidebar with customization controls
- Added ring size calculator
- Implemented basic filters (metal type, stone type, price range)
- Added footer with auto-updating year

### CAD Integration Features
- Integrated CAD API for real-time model updates
- Implemented dynamic pricing calculator
- Added stone placement customization
- Created realistic lighting and reflection system
- Added 360-degree model rotation controls

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented debouncing for model updates
- Added proper model caching
- Optimized 3D rendering performance
- Added progressive loading for high-quality textures

### Deployment Setup
- Configured GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Set up custom domain (ringly.io)
- Created comprehensive ROADMAP.md for feature planning

## Key Decisions

### Technical Choices
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: MUI Joy for consistent UI components
- **3D Rendering**: ThreeJS/WebGL for realistic ring visualization
- **CAD Integration**: [Planned: Research best CAD API options]
- **Backend**: Supabase for real-time database and authentication
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### UI/UX Decisions
- Used elegant, jewelry-inspired color palette
- Implemented smooth transitions between customization states
- Created responsive layout with customization panel
- Added progressive loading and performance optimizations

### Responsive Design Guidelines
- **Hybrid Approach to Units:**
  ```tsx
  // Example of recommended hybrid approach
  sx={{
    padding: '1rem',  // Spacing relative to font size
    width: { md: '320px', lg: '360px' },  // Fixed breakpoints for layout
    fontSize: '1.2rem',  // Typography with rem
    marginBottom: '0.5em'  // Component-relative spacing
  }}
  ```
  - Use `rem`/`em` for:
    - Typography and font-related spacing
    - Component-level padding/margins
    - Elements that should scale with user preferences
  - Use fixed units (`px`) with breakpoints for:
    - Grid-based layouts
    - Precise component widths
    - Maintaining exact proportions for 3D elements

## Next Steps
1. Research and evaluate CAD API options
2. Implement realistic material rendering
3. Create stone customization interface
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Add deployment status monitoring
6. Begin work on features from ROADMAP.md

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Build the client
yarn build:client

# Deploy
yarn deploy

# Development
yarn dev
```

## Notes
- Focus on realistic rendering and visualization
- Maintain smooth performance during model updates
- Ensure accurate pricing calculations
- Regular testing on different devices and browsers
- Prioritize user education about ring customization options
